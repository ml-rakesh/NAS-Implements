# NAS-Implements

## 1.	Overview
NAS automates the manual process of designing neural network’s various tasks like classification and regression. 
In NAS for given datasets, 
•	Define a search space of architectures 
•	Use a search strategy like reinforcement learning, to find the best architecture for the dataset
•	Retrain the model (best architecture) on the dataset and find the performance. 
Below is the basic NAS workflow:
